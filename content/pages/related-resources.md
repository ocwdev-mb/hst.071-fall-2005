Below is a set of suggested Web sites for the course.

The [University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/obgyn/reproductive-endocrine-infertility/) Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility has an excellent medical education site. Included are a [glossary](https://library.med.utah.edu/kw/human_reprod/glossary.html) of common terms, six clinical [cases](https://library.med.utah.edu/kw/human_reprod/cases/), a basic [review](https://library.med.utah.edu/kw/human_reprod/review.html) of selected topics, and some [self-tests](https://library.med.utah.edu/kw/human_reprod/quiz/).

Loyola University has a wonderful [Histology index](http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/frames/histo_frames.html) you can view online. View male and female reproductive tracts, and try some self tests!

Quiz yourself on WebPath's [Organ System Pathology Exam](https://webpath.med.utah.edu/EXAM/MULTORG/examidx.htm).

You can also get 2D images from the [Visible Human Male and Female Projects](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html). Remember hearing about the comdemned man agreeing to be sliced 1,000 times? Now they have a 59 year old woman. No labels, unfortunately.

Review the development of the human embryo in dazzling color with [The Visible Embryo](http://www.visembryo.com/baby/index.html). Beautiful graphical work for a Web site.

The University of Missouri has a single case of [breast cancer](https://profilers.evaliahealth.com/v3/850cf624-db99-4822-8769-3832d70f39f5?hcmacid=a0i3u000007Jizy&_ga=2.143336885.1001536660.1611337362-1911617389.1611337362) on line, with different options presented to the student.

The University of Wisconsin Surgery Department has an up to date clinical reference on [Benign Breast Disease and Breast Cancer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa044383).
